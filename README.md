# ft_printf

*This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by lhaydar <lhaydar@student.42beirut.com>.*

## Description
`ft_printf` is a project that re-implements the standard C `printf` function.  
The goal of this project is to deepen understanding of:
- Variadic functions in C (`va_list`, `va_start`, `va_arg`, `va_end`)
- Format specifiers handling (`%d`, `%s`, `%x`, `%p`, `%c`, `%i`, `%u`, `%x`, `%X`, `%%` )
- This project also emphasizes careful memory management and robust error handling.
